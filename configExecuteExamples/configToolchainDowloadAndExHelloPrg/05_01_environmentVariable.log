#Setup Path to  ESP8266_RTOS_SDK

#The toolchain programs access ESP8266_RTOS_SDK using IDF_PATH enviroment variable. This
#variable should be set up on your PC, otherwise projects will not build. Setting may be done
#manually, each time PC is restarted. Another option is to set up it permanently by defining
#IDF_PaTH in user profile.

#Add in the profile file, if it don't exist
$ vim ~/.profile

# set path for original ESP8266 RTOS SDK
#export IDF_PATH="$HOME/myhome/esp8266/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK"
# set path for personal RTOS 
export IDF_PATH="$HOME/myhome/esp8266/esp8266RTOS"

#Use the following command in your terminal to add new path
source ~/.profile
#command to verify if PATH is correcty set
printenv IDF_PATH
